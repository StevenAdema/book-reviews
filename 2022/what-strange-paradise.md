⭐⭐⭐

 

**Briefly** <br>

A Syrian migrant washes up on the beach of Greek island. The book is divided into ‘before’ and ‘after’ chapters that pace it well, but takes away any suspense in the ‘before’ portion.  The details of the refugee’s story left me with questions and prompted some great book club discussion.

 

**Takeaways**<br>

*Self Deception*<br>

In both the ‘before’ and ‘after’ plots, characters are faced with the question: Is it ok to believe something that isn’t true if it helps you? The naivete of refugees to believe in a benevolent West and a better life on the other side of the sea provides strength to complete an arduous journey. This self-deception is criticized by others in the book as living in a fantasy disconnected from reality and has allowed the believers to be exploited. Similarly, Vanna contemplates this as well when giving encouragement to Amir in their journey.

 

*Engines and Fuel*<br>

The book takes an interesting arc in its view on race/ancestry determinism. Colonel Kethros admits that he once could distinguish the native from tourist by the “smell of their marrow” but no longer.  Vanna, early on thinks of ancestry as a shackle that can never be fully unclasped, but eventually departs the island leaving behind her family. On the boat, the migrants share their practices for disguising their accent, religion and name to increase their chances for adoption in the West.

The people of the world are better classified into two categories: engines and fuel. The dynamics of exploiter and exploited trump race and ancestry.

 

**Conclusion**<br>

The story itself is simple and heavily inspired by the death of Alan Kurdi, a Syrian boy, who was found dead on a Turkish beach in 2015. I wouldn’t recommend it as a go-to book for insights into the journey of a refugee, however. The majority of the boat scenes often felt more like a platform for the author’s musings on the refugee crisis than plot or character development.  Most of the characters are cartoonishly simple in their motivations, but the author uses them well to bring up questions that stayed with me after the book was closed.

For now, maybe. But you can’t bet your future on work that requires the coming together 
of people, not now, not with the world the way it is. The days of people coming together 
are ending; this is a time for coming apart.

The West you talk about doesn’t exist. It’s a fairy tale, a fantasy you sell yourself 
because the alternative is to admit that you’re the least important character in your 
own story. You invent an entire world because your conscience demands it, you invent 
good people and bad people and you draw a neat line between them because your 
simplistic morality demands it. But the two kinds of people in this world aren’t good 
and bad—they’re engines and fuel. Go ahead, change your country, change your name, 
change your accent, pull the skin right off your bones, but in their eyes they will 
always be engines and you will always, always be fuel.
