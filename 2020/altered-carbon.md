⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Briefly** <br>
Cyberpunk murder mystery where consciousness can be downloaded into different bodies and Eath's elites have been alive for centuries.

**Takeaways**<br>
*Meths*<br>
In a world where concsiousness can be uploaded into new sleeves (natural or synthetic bodies), those who are rich enough can indefinitely extend their life and accumulate incredible wealth and power.  Morgan explores the dichotemy between two classes of humans in the future: those who can't afford immortatlity, and the meths.

*Stacks*<br>
Consciousness on a disk.  An individual's entire memory and experience saved to a drive that can uploaded into any sleeve. Are humans solely their previous experience? What happens when a single consciousness is uploaded into two sleeves simulataneously (a major crime in the book called 'double-sleeving')? What is the impact of a body on the mind? 

*AI*<br>
One of the most noteworthy minor characters is an AI. What if AI felt as passionately about meeting their purpose, eg. running a successful hotel, as humans did about their basic needs for survival? It's an interesting way of humanizing AI that brings the character to life.

**Conclusion**<br>
A brutal, jam-packed murder mystery built on top of extremely interesting technologies and concepts. For better or worse, the book's action and twists drive the narrative.  I'm looking forward to seeing how Morgan builds off this fantastic book through the series.

```
They are what we once dreamed of as gods, mythical agents of destiny, as inescapable as Death, 
that poor old peasant laborer, bent over his scythe, no longer is. Poor Death, no match for the
mighty altered-carbon technologies of data storage and retrieval arrayed against him. 
Once we lived in terror of his arrival. Now we flirt outrageously with his somber dignity, 
and beings like these won’t even let him in the tradesman’s entrance.
