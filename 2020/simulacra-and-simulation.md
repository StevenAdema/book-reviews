**Briefly** <br>
Is it possible to love the ideas of a philosopher but find his work terribly unreadable?

**Takeaways**<br>
*Borges’ Map*<br>
Borges fable imagines an empire where a map is created with such exactitude that it eventually becomes a full scale, one-to-one representation of the entire empire. Baudrillard compares the abstraction of the map to our current disconnect with the real that our current simulations abstract from. Even further, we have build abstractions on top of abstractions, a  "precession of simulacra", that are so longer even tied to a reality.

*Hyperreal*<br>
The final and fourth stage of simulation, pure simulacrum.  The simulacrum is built on only the artificial and has no ties to reality. 

*Sign Value* <br>
The sign value supersedes the object and pragmatic value of many modern commodities.  

*The Gulf War Did Not Take Place*<br>
Traditionally the the real proceeds the simulation.  In the first Gulf War, the image of war preceded real war (*The Fulg War Will Not Take Place*).  The American military did not engage in the combat traditional to other wars.  The media presentations offer a stylized, selective representation through simulacra so that the viewer's understanding is misrepresent through layers of simulacra.

**Conclusion**<br>
This one gets marked down as a DNF.  As much as I loved the philosophy that inspired two of my favourite movies (The Matrix and American Psycho), I found the book a heavy slog.  It's hard to square my rating with an appreciation for insightful and relevant I find Baudrillard's ideas.

```
Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept.
Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance.
It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal.
― Jean Baudrillard
