**Briefly** <br>
What non-war event led to the deaths of at least 45 million people?  Prior to hearing Frank Dikotter on EconTalk and reading this book I would have never known about China's most devastating catastrophe. Frank Dikotter uses archive access to tell the tragic story of China's Great Leap Forward under leader Mao Zedong.

**Takeaways**<br>
*The Great Leap Forward*<br>
In January 1958, inspired by Khrushchev's earlier proposal that the Soviet Union will overtake the United States in industrial output in the next 15 years, Mao Zedong declares that China will surpass the United Kingdom in grain and steel production. A campaign is launched to rapidly transform and develop China's agricultural and industrial sectors. The hope was that mobilizing a massive supply of cheap labour organized into communes would avoid bottlenecks created by social stratification.

*Communism*<br>
Communist policies such as mandatory agricultural collectivization drove the Great Leap Forward. Private property was largely abolished, household items were seized to fuel the backyard furnaces, and many were forced to live in people's communes. A third of all grain was sold to the state at fixed prices. Religious ceremonies were banned and replaced with political ceremonies (propaganda).

*Causes of the Famine*<br>
There is debate about how much blame lies with Mao vs natural weather and famine for the starvation.  Frank Dikotter makes a compelling case for causation between the policies and outcome.  Additionally, Mao's own words reveal more than just negligence, but a  democide. A page could be filled with the policies that wreaked havoc on the crops and economy.  The backyard furnaces, extermination of all pests, and deep plowing were particularly memorable. 
To summarize one of these, deep plowing up to two meters was mandated under the belief that it would encourage plants to grow deeper roots and produce more fruit.  The flawed agricultural innovation was carried out with fervor by local cadres who forced the workers to go beyond the already absurd recommended depths. The opportunity for promotion by dutiful implementation and inflated output numbers exasperated the rural shortages. Not only was the output of grain diminished, but by grossly reporting the actual figures, the state would take more than the 30% already allotted.
The same situation played out on a national scale when China exported grain below cost in an attempt to masquerade communism's success.

**Conclusion**<br>
I couldn't help reading the planning, regulation and redistribution under Maoist regime with the dystopian outcome of the government's policies in Ayn Rand's *Atlas Shrugged*. For four years under Mao, a vast array of social, economic, industrial, and agricultural policies and their disastrous outcomes are meticulously recanted by Dikotter.  There is no outright condemnation of communist philosophy, but the events that took place under Mao in 1958-62 read as a scathing critique against totalitarian regime's leader and political foundation.

But in reality a dictatorship never has one dictator only, as 
many people become willing to scramble for power over the next 
person above them. The country was full of local hegemons,
each trying to deceive the next one up into believing that their 
achievements were genuine.
