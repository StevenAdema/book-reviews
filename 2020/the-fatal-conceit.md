**Briefly** <br>
I was introduced to Hayek through Russ Robert's podcast EconTalk.  The Fatal Conceit is well argued and gave me a new appreciation for the forces at work that make up the modern economy.

**Takeaways**<br>
*The Fatal Conceit*<br>
"The idea that the ability to acquire skills stems from reason".  Hayek critiques the idea that social planners can create a more efficient and prosperous society.  The rationalist construction of an ethical system will fail because reason, a product of evolution, is incapable of commanding dispersed information.

*Extended Order*<br>
The extended order is a *description* or *result* of a system that adopts specialization and trade.  Widely dispersed information is transmitted via price signals so that individuals make informed choices even though they(and no other single entity) is fully away of the knowledge that produced the signal. Like other artificial constructs (language, art, values), the extended order is the evolved results of natural selection.

*Ethics*<br>
If our behaviours are market directed, our moral traditions are not purely instinctual but spontaneous and self-ordering as well.  This new 'altruism' is not an end pursued for it's own sake, but simply the result of following the basic rules of conduct in a society whose foundation is in an extended order. Paradoxically, following these roles bends our efforts towards actions that enable us to benefit that which could be done of our own knowledge. 

**Conclusion**<br>
Hayek articulates clearly both the nature of capitalist economies and why the socialism desire to improve upon the market process is doomed for failure. I read this book after *The Road To Serfdom*, but wish I had done so the other way around.  I really enjoyed this book and definitely finished it with more highlights than my averagne non-fiction read.

Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept.
Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance.
It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal.
