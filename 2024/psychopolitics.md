**Briefly** <br>

I was introduced to Byung-Chul Han through the very excellent podcast *Philosophize This!*. The podcast is easier to absorb and more enjoyable but I'm glad I read the book as well which really helped the ideas sink in.

I appreciate that Byung-Chul Han's reflections on power structures and individualism in *Pyshopolitics* direct and practical. I can't say I enjoyed reading the book but it is one that I think about often.

**Takeaways**<br>

*Exploitation of Freedom*<br>

Byung-Chul Han starts off with a banger: "We are living in a particular phase of history: freedom itself is bringing forth compulsion and constraint". In contrast to previous societies limited by negativity (constraints), modern individuals face the dangers of positivity, the imperaritive to always achieve more and more. We are not subject any longer to state, religion or community. Instead we self-exploit to attain success on the market.
 

*Individualism*<br>

Lorem ipsum.

 

**Conclusion**<br>


 
<br><br>

```

But the violence of positivity is just as destructive as the 
violence of negativity... The neoliberal subject is running 
aground on the imperative of self-optimization, that is, on the
compulsion always to achieve more and more. Healing, it turns out,
means killing
