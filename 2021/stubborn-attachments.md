⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Briefly** <br>
Growth is good. Wealthier societies are more stable, offer better living standards, produce better medicines, and ensure greater autonomy, greater fulfillment, and more leisure activities. Cowen makes a moral case for maximizing sustainable economic growth. Bold and intriguing throughout.

**Takeaways**<br>
*Tyler Cowen*<br>
As a long time listener of the 'Conversations with Tyler' podcaster and read of his blog _Marginal Revolution_, is was only time before I read Cowen's concise summary of hit general philosophical outlook.  While the book is well argued, I much prefer hearing Cowen articulate these positions.  I would definitely recommend first to check out his Stanford lecture 'Is Economic Growth a Moral Imperative' on Youtube before this book.

*Ponderings*<br>
One of the primary reasons I read and listen to Tyler Cowen is the topics and questions he raises that I wouldn't have thought of myself. 

At what rate should "time discount" lives in the future?

How can one make decisions when the full set of outcomes of any action can never be known?

Why eat an ice cream cone when someone in Malawi is starving?

today in the United States we are spending too much on the elderly and not enough 
on the young.

The splendors of the modern world are not just frivolous baubles; they are important
sources of human comfort and well-being.

1. What can we do to boost the rate of economic growth?
2. What can we do to make our civilization more stable?
3. How should we deal with environmental problems?
...these questiosn should be central to every political body.
