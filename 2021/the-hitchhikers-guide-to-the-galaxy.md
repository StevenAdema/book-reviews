⭐⭐⭐

**Briefly** <br>
A quirky sci-fi classic that betrayed my expectations for a book first published in 1979.

**Takeaways**<br>
*Alien Insights*<br>
My favourite thing about science fiction is the ability to look at a piece of humanness from a completely different vantage. The insight from alien perspective is often humorous and sharply insightful. To me, this is the shining piece of Hitchhiker's that makes to book so enjoyable.

Why do humans talk so much making benign statements like 'Wow, the weather sure is nice today' when it is so clearly obvious? To keep our brains from turning off of course! If humans don't consistently exercise their tongue the brain atrophies.

How can you tell if a starship is new? By the sales pamphlet that has been left out on the console extolling the exciting, extravagent lives of spaceship owners.


*Quotable*<br>
I'm writing this summary a month after reading this book, so I went on goodreads to refresh my memory.  Reading a number of the quotes I'm reminded how provoking a number of them.  Interestingly, on first pass, their impact to me is lost in the quick pace of the stories events. Additionally, it's hard to parse out mid-story the difference between plain silly and insightful. This nuance adds a layer of depth which no-doubt contributed to it's status as a classic and a favourite for multiple re-reads.

**Conclusion**<br>
Douglas Adams' simple and silly style made Hitchhiker's a very enjoyable read. I've slotted it at three star however since the unorthodox timeline and progression of the story felt like they detracted from the better aspects of the book: it's insights and humour.

For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than 
dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the 
dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the 
dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the 
same reasons

Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there 
are fairies at the bottom of it too?
